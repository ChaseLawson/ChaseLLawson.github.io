### My story

Hello! I am an experienced Writing and Literary Development professional with
over 2 years of proven expertise in creative writing and editorial support.

I attend Loyola University Maryland pursuing a degree in Writing with a minor in African and African American Studies, I am eager to further immerse myself in the publishing industry and gain hands-on experience that aligns with my academic background and career aspirations.

With skills in storytelling, editing, research, and communication, I am able to craft
compelling narratives, support manuscript development, and achieve polished,
publication-ready work. I am adept at using Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Outlook, WordPress, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Excel and Canva.

My adaptable skill set, commitment to organized development to produce literary
excellence, and passion for discovering and creating new voices position me as a
valuable asset. In my spare time, I like to read fiction novels, go to the gym, and crochet.
