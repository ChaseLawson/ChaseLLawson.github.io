## Monday Vent Session

Today, tucked away while hunched over a textbook at the Fernandez Center, swaddled in stress and homework assignments for tomorrow, I was laser-focused doing exactly what everyone should do: minding my own business. Until, of course, I wasn’t. Until I did what everyone also does more often than we care to admit, being nosey allowing curiosity to tug at me, pull me away from tasks, and inevitably lead me into something beautifully unexpected. The girl, not right next to me a few chairs away, caught my attention with her sighs and soft sobs. 

So there I was, abandoning the tense focus, sidestepping boundaries, and walked over. Having a spontaneous Monday vent session is absolutely not on my to-do list, whereas QQTP (Questions, Quotes, Talking Points) for my 10 am definitely was. But there I was anyway, now seated directly beside her making my presence known with a soft “Hey.” Now no one wants their tears witnessed, but here I was, an accidental spectator. She looked at me, and I looked back to eyes raw and glistening. Then I said what I often whisper to myself in similar moments, a cliché but vital words: “It will all be okay.” A statement soaked in contradiction and hope sometimes the act of saying it, even when it feels like a lie, plants a tiny hope. I asked if she wanted to talk. I offered my ears, willing to listen.

I listened. I listened as a sophomore who once, not long ago, occupied the rough freshman trench. Maybe I was trying to fulfill some sense of duty. She is currently failing a class and feeling the creeping pressure to withdraw from it before the class crushed her gpa; the homesickness of being thousands of miles from California, Maryland suddenly feeling impossibly far; the loneliness that comes from seeing your roommate bond with others. The complex uncertainty of school and life all of it so real, raw, and relatable. A true empath, perhaps.
I offered small scraps of advice that might ease her burden, but mostly, I let her speak. There was something sacred about it, with no judgment, only understanding. Being available to her shifted something inside me. And then there was the gift, the spark of relief. This was not just a chance encounter, in a world that often feels indifferent.

By the time we finished, over an hour had passed. My untouched books and notes lay forgotten, scattered across at the other table. I went to grab my things, and we shifted to study-mode together. When we left the Fernandez Center, her smile was something I was happy to see walking away with now a new friend on campus. I realized then, in the aftermath, the delight of it all. The listening, of stepping away from my own stress to hold space for another. It was inconvenient, yes. But it brought delight unexpectedly.
