## Last Name

What would you rather classify as?

Over the years I think to ask

An asshole 

A half deadbeat 

Just a deadbeat 

Take your pick

You started by arguing 

Over a name in New York Presbyterian

You missed age three to five 

Make an appearance not too long

God forbid you drop your damn MO 

Flake again leave at fourteen 

This time you never come back 

Guess the ass you bought for Tanya

Was a plastic distraction

Made to help you forgoet

But I’ll never forget the night 

We watched Scarface 

I’ll never forget just like you

I have the same surname

The only one who cared about you 

For what a relationship 

Comical the better term is stranger 

Not dad

No emotional connection in sight
