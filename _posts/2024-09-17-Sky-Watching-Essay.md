## Sky Watching

After class, I spontaneously decided to grab a blanket, a bag of Kettle Cooked Lays Jalapeño chips, my phone, and headphones, and stuff it all into my Trader Joe's tote bag, the super cool one all Trader Joe's stans have. Every once in a while I like to do random shit, sorry stuff, activities, endeavors.We are working on proper vocabulary as a college student, especially as a writing major. I need a glob of soap to wash my mouth out. I believe doing random things at least once a week helps to say you're living the college experience especially at my sometimes very boring predominately white institution. But anyway, thank God I brought ninety-nine sweaters to college despite the lack of closet space. I threw one on with some sweats and went to the quad. It was a decently cool day. Mind you, it's ten p.m. right now; the campus is so quiet at this time, the volumes typically at 100 from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. 

Once I got settled and laid down, thinking I was all alone, I looked to my right and not too far away, I saw two dudes and a girl. I saw their eyes fixed up above, their necks cranked back at the perfect medium—not too far back that it hurt, not too far forward to miss the view. 

The fixation was understandable; looking up at the evidence and reasoning, I couldn't help but be amazed. There they were, the stars sparkling and gleaming back at you, traveling with my line of view. It was so romantic, so intimate, and so beautiful. It was almost as if they were performing in the sky, displaying patterns randomly glowing, moving, and swaying as I turned my head and moved my eyes. The stars waltzed slowly, their distant light shimmering through the crisp, cool atmosphere, creating a contrast against the inky sky.  All the stars in the sky are in uniform on display for the night show, oblivious to the audience they have below. 

I slowed and started to embrace the silent conversations I was having with the stars when, to my left, I heard a ton of feet. It turns out a whole bunch of freshmen came outside to do the same. Although I couldn't help but ask where their clothes were, as they sat on the grass with no blanket to block the breeze, bare butts on the grass. 

But who am I to judge, as the stars shine here with no judgment towards us as we all stare for what feels like an eternity. Damn sky I guess you are that hypnotizing how delightful.
